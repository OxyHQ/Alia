/**
 * The boot wiring that nothing else can observe.
 *
 * `src/index.ts` opens a socket and starts timers on import, so no test imports
 * it. That is exactly why this gate exists: the expiry sweeper was written,
 * registered against fourteen targets and covered by real-database tests, and
 * **nothing ever called `startExpirySweeper()`**. Every one of those tests
 * invoked `runExpirySweep()` directly, so the whole mechanism was green and
 * inert at the same time — the sweep worked and was never run.
 *
 * A source-text assertion is weak evidence about behaviour, and it is the
 * strongest available here. It is the same shape `deployWorkflow.test.ts` uses
 * for the workflow YAML, and it fails for the one reason that actually occurred:
 * the call being absent.
 *
 * The vacuity floor matters more than usual. `readFileSync` of a path that
 * moved, or a file emptied by a bad merge, produces a string containing none of
 * these markers — which is indistinguishable from a correct file that lost the
 * call, and would report the same "not found" either way. So the file is
 * asserted to be recognisably `index.ts` first.
